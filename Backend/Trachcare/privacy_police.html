      <h1>TrachCare - Optimizing Tracheostomy Care</h1>

      <h2>Abstract of Invention</h2>
      <p>
        Tracheostomy, a surgical procedure involving the creation of an airway through the neck, is often necessitated by various medical conditions.
        Following tracheostomy, patients require meticulous care to manage their airways, prevent complications, and optimize their quality of life.
        However, home care poses significant challenges due to its complexity and need for continuous monitoring.
